RDFa Distiller for Rdfa Parser.

== Description:
RDFa is a specification  for attributes to be used with XHTML or SVG Tiny to express structured data.
The rendered, hypertext data of XHTML is reused by the RDFa markup,
so that publishers donâ€™t need to repeat significant data in the document content.
The underlying abstract representation is RDF, which lets publishers build their own vocabulary, extend  others,
and evolve their vocabulary with maximal interoperability over time.
rdfa_parser is a distiller that generates the RDF triples from an (X)HTML+RDFa or SVG Tiny 1.2 file
in various RDF serialization formats.
It can either be used directly from a command line or via a CGI service.
It corresponds to the RDFa[http://www.w3.org//TR/2008/REC-rdfa-syntax-20081014] Recommendation,
published on the 14th of October, 2008, and, for the SVG version,
to the SVG[http://www.w3.org/TR/2008/REC-SVGTiny12-20081222/] Tiny 1.2 Recommendation,
published on the 22nd of December, 2008.
The distiller can be used to start the service installed at this site.
To learn more about RDFa, please consult the RDFA Syntax[href="http://www.w3.org/TR/rdfa-syntax] Document.

rdfa_parser is a Ruby Gem implementation of RDFa. It is available for download and integration as open-source.
